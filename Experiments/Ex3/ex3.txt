Enter your command: askuser_sub: Is there any task I can assist you with?
hey, i wanted to know if there are any plants in the room
Enter your command: askuser_sub: Yes, based on the robot's memory, there is an image from April 29th, 2025, indicating the presence of a plant in the room. Is there anything else I can assist with?
askuser_sub: Yes, based on the robot's memory, there is an image from April 29th, 2025, at 01:50:45 that indicates the presence of a plant in the room. Is there anything else I can assist with?
yeah, can you go and check if the plant is still there
Enter your command: askuser_sub: The plant has been checked and it is still in good condition. Is there anything else I can assist with?
thanks 
Enter your command: askuser_sub: The plant has been checked and it is still in good condition. Is there anything else I can assist with?
okay, thanks, nothing else
