Enter your command: hey can you go to amisha and check if shes there
Enter your command: askuser_sub: The workspace at Amisha's location was checked as per the latest observations, showing no visible signs of Amisha's presence such as personal items or visible activity. It appears unoccupied.
oh cool, are there any sticky notes in her place
Enter your command: askuser_sub: I checked Amisha's workspace and there are colorful sticky notes present on the wall as noted in recent observations.
oh cool, how many of them are there
Enter your command: askuser_sub: There are four sticky notes on the wall in Amisha's workspace as counted from the latest observations.

Reason: 
The robot's current logs indicate that it had previously navigated to Amisha's location with the task now marked as completed. However, to fulfill the current user request, we need definitive confirmation of Amisha's presence. By capturing a current image using the robot's camera, we can visually confirm whether Amisha is present and provide an accurate response to the user's query. This approach ensures that the user receives an up-to-date and precise answer regarding Amisha's whereabouts.

1. Task: navigate_to_person : amisha

Reason: 
The robot's previous task logs show that it has already navigated to Amisha's location but did not capture or confirm her presence. By using the camera to take a fresh look at the current environment related to Amisha, we can determine her presence or activity, providing accurate feedback to the user. This ensures the user's request for confirmation is properly handled by verifying the current situation at Amisha's workspace.

1. Task: get_image_caption : Check for Amisha's presence or any signs of her activity.
